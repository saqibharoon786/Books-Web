Criminal Law – Mini Textbook (5 Chapters, Approx. 5 Pages)

  -----------------------------------------
  ## CHAPTER 1 – INTRODUCTION TO CRIMINAL
  LAW Criminal law is the area of law that
  deals with acts considered harmful to
  society. It defines what constitutes a
  crime, sets the rules for investigation
  and prosecution, and establishes
  punishments for offenders. Criminal law
  aims to maintain public order, protect
  citizens, and ensure justice.
  -----------------------------------------
  ## CHAPTER 2 – ELEMENTS OF A CRIME Every
  crime has essential elements that must be
  present for an accused to be legally
  responsible. These elements include:

  ### 1. Actus Reus (The Guilty Act) This
  refers to the physical action or illegal
  omission. An individual must have
  committed the act voluntarily.

  ### 2. Mens Rea (The Guilty Mind) This
  means intention or knowledge of
  wrongdoing. Different crimes require
  different levels of mens rea—intentional,
  reckless, or negligent behavior.

  ### 3. Concurrence The guilty act and the
  guilty mind must happen together.

  ### 4. Causation The defendant’s actions
  must directly cause the harm or outcome.

  ### 5. Harm Some crimes require actual
  harm, while others only require the act
  itself (such as possession of illegal
  items).

  These elements ensure that the law
  punishes only those who are responsible
  and acted intentionally or negligently.

  ## CHAPTER 5 – CRIMINAL JUSTICE PROCESS
  The criminal justice process includes
  several stages:

  ### 1. Investigation Police gather
  evidence, interview witnesses, and
  identify suspects.

  ### 2. Arrest A suspect may be arrested
  based on evidence or a warrant issued by
  a court.

  ### 3. Charges The prosecutor decides
  what charges, if any, will be filed.

  ### 4. Trial Both sides present evidence.
  The prosecution must prove guilt beyond
  reasonable doubt.

  ### 5. Sentencing If found guilty, the
  judge imposes a punishment—such as
  imprisonment, fines, or probation.

  ### 6. Appeal The convicted person may
  challenge the decision in a higher court.

  The goal of the criminal justice system
  is fairness, accuracy, and protection of
  the rights of both victims and accused
  individuals.
